## Jessie
React.js web app designed to help people live financially healthier lives using data from CapitalOne's Nessie API, built during HackNC.

Jessie takes critical financial data from Nessie, like total savings, expenditures over the last 6 months, and income over the last 6 months to tailor a financial goal and show people how to build wealth.

This project is built on the [Ani-Theme](https://github.com/start-react/ani-theme.git) in React.JS.
